# How to Convert Functions into UDFs in Pyspark

We have a Spark dataframe and want to apply a specific transformation to a column/a set of columns. In Pandas, we can use the *map()* and *apply()* functions. The Spark equivalent is the udf (user-defined function). A user defined function is generated in two steps. In step one, we create a normal python function, which is then in step two converted into a udf, which can then be applied to the data frame. 

This entry shows how to code and use a udf. First, we take a look at how to proceed in the simplest case: 
a function with one
input and one output variable. Afterwards we level up our udf abilities and use a function with multiple in- and 
output variables. Code has been tested for Spark 2.1.1.

A general remark: When dealing with udfs, it is important to be aware of the type of output that your function returns. If you get the output data types wrong, your udf will return only nulls.

For both of the examples we need to import the following modules:
```
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, struct, col
from pyspark.sql.types import * 
import pyspark.sql.functions as func
```

## Level 0: One-In-One-Out
### Step 1: Define your function
I was recently recoding binned ages into numeric format. This is an abbreviated version of a function that takes a string, compares it to several options and finally returns a float.
```
def extractAge(mystring):
    if mystring.strip() == 'age 18-25':
        return 21.5
    if mystring.strip() == 'age 26-35':
        return 30.5
    else:
        return None
```

### Step 2: Create the udf (user-defined function)
The function *extractAge()* takes a single input and returns a single output of type float. The udf-syntax therefore is:
```
extract_age_udf = udf(lambda row: extractAge(row), FloatType())
```
The return type (here FloatType) can be any of the [standard Spark datatypes](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html?highlight=types#module-pyspark.sql.types)

### Step 3: Usage
Create a test dataframe:
```
df = sc.parallelize([[1., 'age 18-25'], [2., 'age 100+']]).toDF(["f1","age"])
df.show()
>>>
+---+---------+
| f1|      age|
+---+---------+
|1.0|age 18-25|
|2.0| age 100+|
+---+---------+
```
Apply function:
```
df_new = df.withColumn('age_n', extract_age_udf(col('age')))
df_new.show()
>>>
+---+---------+-----+
| f1|      age|age_n|
+---+---------+-----+
|1.0|age 18-25| 21.5|
|2.0| age 100+| null|
+---+---------+-----+
```

## Levelling up: Many-In-Many-Out

### Step 1: Define your function
Let’s assume we want to create a function which takes as input two columns and returns the sum and the difference of the two columns.

```
def sum_diff(f1, f2):
	return [f1 + f2, f1-f2]
```

### Step 2: Create the udf
Since the function now returns a vector, we can’t just use the FloatType() data type anymore, we need to first assemble the schema of the output. Both the elements are of type float, so the schema looks like this:

```
schema = StructType([
    StructField("sum", FloatType(), False),
    StructField("diff", FloatType(), False)
])
```

Having defined the schema, we can define the udf as follows:
```
sum_diff_udf = udf(lambda row: sum_diff(row[0], row[1]), schema)
```

Alternatively, we can define function and udf as
```
def sum_diff(row):
	return [row[0] + row[1], row[0]-row[1]]
	
sum_diff_udf = udf(lambda row: sum_diff(row), schema)
```
and still get the same output.


### Step 3: Usage
Create a test dataframe:
```
df = spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame([[1., 2.], [2., 4.]], columns=['f1', 'f2']))
df.show()
>>>
+---+---+
| f1| f2|
+---+---+
|1.0|2.0|
|2.0|4.0|
+---+---+
```

Apply function:
```
df_new = test_data.withColumn("sum_diff", sum_diff_udf(struct([col('f1'), col('f2')])))\
	.select('*', 'sum_diff.*')
df_new.show()

>>>
+---+---+----------+---+----+
| f1| f2|  sum_diff|sum|diff|
+---+---+----------+---+----+
|1.0|2.0|[3.0,-1.0]|3.0|-1.0|
|2.0|4.0|[6.0,-2.0]|6.0|-2.0|
+---+---+----------+---+----+

```

Update: I just found [this post](https://towardsdatascience.com/pyspark-udfs-and-star-expansion-b50f501dcb7b) 
commenting on execution plans for the * expansion. 
It suggests, wrapping the results in an array and then exploding the array. While the exploding has some drawbacks, it means,
that you only need to execute the udf once, which is good, since udfs are inherently slow to execute. Adapting this idea for the example 
above leads to a code like this:
```
df_new = (
    test_data
    .select(
        '*', func.explode(
                func.array(
                    sum_diff_udf(struct([col('f1'), col('f2')]))
                    )
                ).alias('sum_diff')
    )
    .select('*', col('sum_diff.*'))
)
df_new.show()
```

## Example of What Happens if you get your Output Data Type Wrong
As mentioned above, if you get your output data type wrong, your udf will return nulls. Here is a modified version of the 
one-in-one-out example above. If we assume the return to be float, but in fact, the function returns an integer, the udf returns nulls. Code as above, but modify the function to return an integer while we keep on telling the udf that the function should return a float.
```
def extractAge(mystring):
    if mystring.strip() == 'age 18-25':
        return 21
    if mystring.strip() == 'age 26-35':
        return 30
    else:
        return None
	
extract_age_udf = udf(lambda row: extractAge(row), FloatType())
```
Applying the udf will lead to the output:
```
df_new = df.withColumn('age_n', extract_age_udf(col('age')))
df_new.show()
+---+---------+-----+
| f1|      age|age_n|
+---+---------+-----+
|1.0|age 18-25| null|
|2.0| age 100+| null|
+---+---------+-----+
```
Note, that it does not matter, which are the data types. As long as they are not consistent, the udf will return nulls.
