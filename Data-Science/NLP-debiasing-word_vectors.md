## Calculating the Bias
(Note that you can calculate this bias vector
in different ways. The simplest one is to calculate the distance vector between "woman" and "man". A more general approach 
could be to average over the distance vectors of word-pairs like "woman"-"man", "grandmother"-"grandfather", etc.

# Debiasing non-gender specific words
Let g be the direction of bias, i.e. the direction of the vector from "female" to "male".
